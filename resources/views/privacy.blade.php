            <p>This policy applies to all information collected or submitted on Indigenous website and our apps for iPhone and any other Apple devices and platforms.</p>

            <h2>Information we collect</h2>
            <p>All data in the app is stored on the Micropub and Microsub servers of your choosing. None of your information is passed to any other servers.</p>

            <p>We collect bug reports using the Crashlytics software to make your app experience better.</p>

            <p>Indigenous's app collects aggregate, anonymous statistics, such as the percentage of users who use particular features, to improve the app.</p>

            <h2>Technical basics</h2>
            <p>If you enable notifications, we must store a token to send them. We never use notifications for marketing.</p>

            <p>We use cookies on the site and similar tokens in the app to keep you logged in. Our server software also stores basic technical information, such as your IP address.</p>

            <h2>Information usage</h2>
            <p>We use the information we collect to operate and improve our website, apps, and customer support.</p>

            <p>We may disclose your information in response to subpoenas, court orders, or other legal requirements; to exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims; to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud or abuse, violations of our policies; or to protect our rights and property.</p>

            <p>In the future, we may sell to, buy, merge with, or partner with other businesses. In such transactions, user information may be among the transferred assets.</p>

            <h2>Security</h2>
            <p>We implement a variety of security measures to help keep your information secure. For instance, all communication from the app sends data over HTTPS when possible.</p>

            <h2>Third-party links and content</h2>
            <p>The content in your timeline is based on the feeds that you follow. As such the links and media presented within your timeline have their own independent privacy policies, and we have no responsibility or liability for their content or activities.</p>

            <h2>California Online Privacy Protection Act Compliance</h2>
            <p>We comply with the California Online Privacy Protection Act. We therefore will not distribute your personal information to outside parties without your consent.</p>

            <h2>Childrenâ€™s Online Privacy Protection Act Compliance</h2>
            <p>We never collect or maintain information at our website from those we actually know are under 13, and no part of our website is structured to attract anyone under 13.</p>

            <h2>Information for European Union Customers</h2>
            <p>By using Indigenous and providing your information, you authorize us to collect, use, and store your information outside of the European Union.</p>

            <h2>International Transfers of Information</h2>
            <p>Information may be processed, stored, and used outside of the country in which you are located. Data privacy laws vary across jurisdictions, and different laws may be applicable to your data depending on where it is processed, stored, or used.</p>

            <h2>Your Consent</h2>
            <p>By using our site or apps, you consent to our privacy policy.</p>
